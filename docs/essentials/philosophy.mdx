## The philosophy of haolib

- haolib is designed to be a comprehensive library for building different types of applications, it is a **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_(prefix)">meta</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a>** to solve as many problems as possible.
- haolib considered to be a monolith. It is a single package.
Still, if you do not need some features (for example, you most likely wouldn't need [Web API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) features if you are building
a [Kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Kafka) [consumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem)), you can use only the parts you need.
See [installation](/essentials/installation) for more details.
- haolib is designed to be as implementation-agnostic as possible. It is not tied to any specific database, web framework, or any other dependency.
- haolib is always SOTA. Of course, we will keep a feature implementation if for some reason it becomes legacy, but the vector of development and adding new features is always to be as SOTA as possible.
